# 贝叶斯决策
 
## 1. Introduction

这是一个简单的基于贝叶斯决策构建的二分类任务，利用GaussianNB分类器对心电时序信号分类，再使用Neyman-Pearson Classification对上述问题再次分类

## 2. Environment

python==3.9.7

pytorch==1.11.0

numpy==1.21.6

## 3. Dataset

TwoLeadECG is an ECG data set taken from Physionet [1] and formatted by Eamonn Keogh. The data are originally from MIT-BIH Long-Term ECG Database (ltdb) Record ltdb/15814, begin at time 420 and end at 1019. The task is to distinguish between signal 0 and signal 1.

## 4. Train

### 4.1 Data preprocessing

Data preprocessing is divided into two aspects, one does not perform feature engineering on the original data, and directly enters it into the classifier; The other is inputing all the data into the Tsfresh feature extraction tool in Python to extract features, and input the extracted features into the classifier.

If your Python does not have Tsfresh installed, please do the following

```sh
pip install tsfresh

```

### 4.2 Performance

The classification results based on GaussianNB classifier and Neyman-Pearson Classification are as follows
